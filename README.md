# AngularHenngeChallenge Efforts

1. Created an Angular app with Sample component
2. Used some sample data having mail informations
3. Added filter conditions by getting date range values from a reactive form.
4. Filtering the sample JSON array based on the obtained date range.
5. Converted the given Image into data:image. (It is because, the project is created in StackBlitz, so the image file upload is avoided)

This project was generated with: https://angular-hennge-challenge.stackblitz.io

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
