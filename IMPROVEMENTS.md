##Improvements implemented in the challenge project


1. Angular material theme is used.
2. Added a navigation bar with logo appending to it, instead of background logo.
3. Angular material icons are used in place of the images.
4. Date range picker UI is changed.
5. Added a search Text field is added to filter out with mail properties (say: email address (i.e. from, to, cc, bcc), subject, body)

Please refer the improved version of the challenge application at: https://angular-material-hennge-challenge.stackblitz.io/

##Reason:
Instead of images, we have used icons, themes for better UI. It is a kind of package, made compatible with the Angular framework.

It can be improved with few more options like adding ARCHIVE / UNARCHIEVE button. To move the mails from one status to the other (may be can be move few of the mails from ARCHIVE to UNARCHIVE).
Also, a component can be created in additon to the existing component to add few new mails to the Archiver.
We can also improve the filter on Search button click to Dynamic filter for search text box by using change event.
